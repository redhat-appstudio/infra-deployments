# StoneSoup Infrastructure Deployments

For the full documentation click [here](https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/infra-deployments/docs/introduction/about.html)

This repository is an initial set of Argo-CD-based deployments of StoneSoup components to a cluster, plus a script to bootstrap Argo CD onto that cluster (to drive these Argo-CD-based deployments, via OpenShift GitOps).

This repository is structured as a GitOps monorepo (e.g. the repository contains the K8s resources for *multiple* applications), using [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/).

The contents of this repository are not owned by any single individual, and should instead be collectively managed and maintained through PRs by individual teams. More information about that can be found in the documentation section about how to [Extend The Service](https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/infra-deployments/docs/deployment/extending-the-service.html).
