# AppStudio Infrastructure Deployments

This repository is an initial set of Argo-CD-based deployments of AppStudio components to a cluster, plus a script to bootstrap Argo CD onto that cluster (to drive these Argo-CD-based deployments, via OpenShift GitOps).

This repository is structured as a GitOps monorepo (e.g. the repository contains the K8s resources for *multiple* applications), using [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/).

The contents of this repository are not owned by any single individual, and should instead be collectively managed and maintained through PRs by individual teams.

## How to add your own component

You may use the `gitops` component as an example for how to add your own component. Here `gitops` refers to the GitOps service team's K8s resources.

These are the steps to add your own component:
1) Create a new directory for your team's components, under `components/(team-name)`.
2) Add a `kustomization.yaml` file under that directory, which points to the individual K8s YAML resources you wish to deploy.
    - You may also structure your deployment into directories and files. See the Kustomize documentation for more information, and/or examples below.
    - See `components/gitops/backend` for an example of this.
3) Create an Argo CD `Application` resource in `argo-cd-apps/base/(team-name).yaml`).
    - See `gitops.yaml` for a template of how this should look.
    - The `.spec.source.path` value should point to the directory you created in previous step.
    - The `.spec.destination.namespace` should match the target namespace you wish to deploy your resources to.
    - The `.metadata.name` should correspond to your `(team-name)`
4) Add a reference to your new `(team-name).yaml` file, to `argo-cd-apps/base/kustomization.yaml` (the reference to your YAML file should be in the `resources:` list field).
5) Run `kustomize build (repo root)/argo-cd-apps/overlays/staging` and ensure it passes, and outputs your new Argo CD Application CR.
6) Add an entry in `argo-cd-apps/overlays/development/repo-overlay.yaml` for your new component so you can use the development and preview modes for testing.
7) Open a PR for all of the above.

More examples of using Kustomize to drive deployments using GitOps can be [found here](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog).

## Component testing and building of images
To test and run builds for a component, create the necessary Tekton resources and define a pipeline.
The `gitops` component can be used as an example.

These are the steps to create a component pipeline:
1) Create a `.tekton` directory under the component directory. Example: `components/(team-name)/.tekton`.
2) Create the Tekton resources to trigger and run the pipeline.
    - EventListener: The EventListener processes an incoming request and executes a Trigger. This will bind to a ClusterTriggerBinding.
    - PersistentVolumeClaim: A workspace for the pipeline.
    - ServiceAccount: This will be the service account the pipeline will run as.
    - TriggerTemplate: The trigger template will dynamically generate a PipelineRun resource. This is also where the pipeline is defined.
    - Route: The route will be used as the github webhook address.
    - Kustomization: This is necessary to install the component resources defined above.

## Maintaining your components

Simply update the files under `components/(team-name)`, and open a PR with the changes.

**TIP**: For development purposes, you can use `kustomize build .` to output the K8s resources that are being generated for your folder.

## Bootstrapping a cluster

### Required prerequisites
The prerequisites are:
- You must have `kubectl`, `oc`, `jq` and [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) installed.
- You must have `kubectl` and `oc` pointing to an existing OpenShift cluster, that you wish to deploy to. Alternatively, you can configure a local CodeReady Containers VM to deploy to.
- The script `./hack/setup/install-pre-req.sh` will install these prerequisites for you, if they're not already installed.

### Optional: CodeReady Containers Setup
If you don't already have a test OpenShift cluster available, CodeReady Containers is a popular option. It runs a small OpenShift cluster in a single VM on your local workstation.
1) Create or log in using your free Red Hat account, and [install CodeReady Containers (CRC)](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local).
2) Make sure you have the latest version of CRC: `crc version`
3) Run `./hack/setup/prepare-crc.sh` to configure CodeReady Containers with the recommended minimum memory (16 GiB) and CPUs (6) for App Studio. The script has optional parameters for customizing `memory` and `cpu` allowance. It also supports `force delete` of existing cluster. Run `./hack/setup/prepare-crc.sh --help` to see the options. The script will also enable cluster monitoring and log you in as the cluster administrator.

### Optional: Quicklab storage setup for clusters
If you are using Quicklab to provision your development cluster, you will need to setup storage prior to running the bootstrap script.

See `hack/quicklab/README.md`

### Bootstrap App Studio
Steps:
1) Run `./hack/bootstrap-cluster.sh [$MODE]` which will bootstrap Argo CD (using OpenShift GitOps) and setup the Argo CD `Application` Custom Resources (CRs) for each component. This command will output the Argo CD Web UI route when it's finished. For upstream mode keep the $MODE empty or "upstream". For development mode and preview mode set `$MODE` to `development` or `preview`, the modes are described in section 'Development modes for your own clusters'.
2) Open the Argo CD Web UI to see the status of your deployments. You can use the route from the previous step and login using your OpenShift credentials (using the 'Login with OpenShift' button), or login to the OpenShift Console and navigate to Argo CD using the OpenShift Gitops menu in the Applications pulldown.
![OpenShift Gitops menu with Cluster Argo CD menu option](documentation/images/argo-cd-login.png?raw=true "OpenShift Gitops menu")
3) If your deployment was successful, you should see several applications running, such as "all-components-staging", "gitops", and so on.

#### Post-bootstrap Service Provider Integration(SPI) Configuration
SPI components fails to start right after the bootstrap. It requires manual configuration in order to work properly:
1) Edit `./components/spi/config.yaml` [see SPI Configuraton Documentation](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator#configuration).  
2) In CRC setup add a random string for value of `sharedSecret`
3) Create a `oauth-config` Secret (`kubectl create secret generic oauth-config --from-file=components/spi/config.yaml -n spi-system`)
4) In few moments, SPI pods should start

This process is automated in `preview mode` see below.

SPI Vault instance has to be manually initialized. There is a script to help with that:
1) Make sure that your cluster user has at least permissions `./components/spi/vault_role.yaml`
2) Clone SPI operator repo `git clone https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator && cd service-provider-integration-operator`
3) run `vault-init.sh` script from repo root directory `./hack/vault-init.sh`


#### Post-bootstrap Tekton Chains Configuration

For Chains to work a key pair signing secret is required. You can use `cosign` to generate one and add it to the cluster by running `./hack/chains/create-signing-secret.sh`.

### Install Toolchain (Sandbox) Operators
There are two scripts which you can use:
- `./hack/sandbox-development-mode.sh` for development mode
- `./hack/sandbox-e2e-mode.sh` for E2E mode

Both of the scripts will:
1. Automatically reduce the resources.requests.cpu values in argocd/openshift-gitops resource.
2. Install & configure the Toolchain (Sandbox) operators in the corresponding mode.
3. Print:
    - The landing-page URL that you can use for signing-up for the Sandbox environment that is running in your cluster.
    - Proxy URL.

#### SSO

In development mode, the Toolchain Operators are configured to use Keycloak instance that is internally used by the Sandbox team. If you want to reconfigure it to use your own Keycloak instance, you need to add a few parameters to `ToolchainConfig` resource in `toolchain-host-operator` namespace.
This is an example of the needed parameters and their values:
```yaml
spec:
  host:
    registrationService:
      auth:
        authClientConfigRaw: '{
                  "realm": "sandbox-dev",
                  "auth-server-url": "https://sso.devsandbox.dev/auth",
                  "ssl-required": "none",
                  "resource": "sandbox-public",
                  "clientId": "sandbox-public",
                  "public-client": true
                }'
        authClientLibraryURL: https://sso.devsandbox.dev/auth/js/keycloak.js
        authClientPublicKeysURL: https://sso.devsandbox.dev/auth/realms/sandbox-dev/protocol/openid-connect/certs
      registrationServiceURL: <The landing page URL>
```  

### Optional: CodeReady Containers Post-Bootstrap Configuration
Even with 6 CPU cores, you will need to reduce the CPU resource requests for each App Studio application. Either run `./hack/reduce-gitops-cpu-requests.sh` which will set resources.requests.cpu values to 50m or use `kubectl edit argocd/openshift-gitops -n openshift-gitops` to reduce the values to some other value. More details are in the FAQ below.

## Development modes for your own clusters

Once you bootstrap a cluster above, the root ArgoCD Application and all of the component applications will each point to the upstream repository. Or you can bootstrap cluster directly in mode which you need.

To enable development for a team or individual to test changes on your own cluster, you need to replace the references to `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments.git` with references to your own fork.

There are a set of scripts that help with this, and minimize the changes needed in your forks.

There is a development configuration in `argo-cd-apps/overlays/development` which includes a kustomize overlay that can redirect the default components individual repositorys to your fork.
The script also supports branches automatically. If you work in a checked out branch, each of the components in the overlays will mapped to that branch by setting `targetRevision:`.

There are two workflows for develompent provided:
1) Development mode - work in the feature branch, apply changes related to your fork, revert the changes when the work is done
2) Preview mode - work in a feature branch, apply script which creates new preview branch and create additional commit with for customization

### Development mode

Steps:
1) in your forked repository run `./hack/development-mode.sh` and this will update the root application on the cluster and all of the git repo references in `argo-cd-apps/overlays/development/repo-overlay.yaml`
2) you will need to push the updated references in `argo-cd-apps/overlays/development/repo-overlay.yaml` to your fork. Argo will now sync all the changes from your fork into the cluster
3) You can now make changes to your forked repository and test them via the gitops

4) To submit changes back to the upstream make sure you do not include the modified file `argo-cd-apps/overlays/development/repo-overlay.yaml`.

One option to prevent accidentally including this modified file, you can run the script `./hack/upstream-mode.sh` to reset everything including your cluster to `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments.git` and match the upstream config. You can also checkout the current upstream
` git fetch upstream; git checkout upstream/main -- argo-cd-apps/overlays/development/repo-overlay.yaml` to ensure you have the original file.  

After you commit your changes you can rerun to `./hack/development-mode.sh` and reset your repo to point back to the fork.

Note running these scripts in a clone repo will have no effect as the repo will remain `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments.git`

### Preview mode

Steps:
1) Copy `hack/preview-template.env` to `hack/preview.env` and update new file based on instructions. File `hack/preview.env` should never be included in commit.
2) Work on your changes in a feature branch
3) Run `./hack/preview.sh`, which will do:
  a) New branch is created from your current branch, the name of new branch is `preview-<name-of-current-branch>`
  b) Commit with changes related to your environment is added into preview branch
  c) Preview branch is pushed into your fork
  d) ArgoCD is set to point to your fork and the preview branch
  e) User is switched back to feature branch to create additional changes

If you want to reset your enviroment you can run the script `./hack/upstream-mode.sh` to reset everything including your cluster to `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments.git` and match the upstream config.

Note running these scripts in a clone repo will have no effect as the repo will remain `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments.git`

### Optional: Configure HAS GitHub Organization

After deployment `has` application is failing to start. It's trying to connect to default github organization and credentials are not set.

To run HAS in development mode, you need to set custom GitHub organization and token.

Steps:
1) Create organization in GitHub
2) Create user token with permissions:
    - `repo`
    - `delete_repo`
3) Set environment variables (for preview mode in `hack/preview.env`):
    - `MY_GITHUB_ORG`
    - `MY_GITHUB_TOKEN`
4) Run `./hack/development-mode.sh` or `./hack/preview.sh`
5) Trigger update in ArgoCD and delete `application-service-controller-manager` pod manually or run `oc rollout restart -n application-service deployment/application-service-controller-manager`

## Authentication

Authentication is managed by `components/authentication`. Authentication is disabled in development modes.

For access to Stage cluster the github user has to be part of `stage` team in `redhat-appstudio-sre` organization.

Access to namespaces is managed by `components/authentication` where `User` is github account and `Group` is team of `redhat-appstudio` organization.

Users can be added to organizations by Michal Kovarik <mkovarik@redhat.com> and by Shoubhik Bose <shbose@redhat.com>.

## Quality Dashboard

Quality dashboard is managed by `components/quality-dashboard`.

By default the frontend is using AppStudio Staging cluster for backend. If you want to use backend on your cluster you need to set secrets for `rds-endpoint`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `github-token` in `quality-dashboard` namespace and also push `components/quality-dashboard/frontend/kustomization.yaml`(the route to backend is changed by script `hack/util-set-quality-dashboard-backend-route.sh` in development and preview cluster modes).

More information about quality-dashboard you can found in repo: `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/quality-dashboard`.

# App Studio Build System

The App Studio Build System is composed of the following components:

1. OpenShift Pipelines.
2. AppStudio-specific Pipeline Definitions in `build-templates` for building images.
3. AppStudio-specific `ClusterTasks`.

This repository installs all the components and includes a set of example scripts that simplify usage and provide examples of a working system. There are no additional components needed to use the build system API, however some utilities and scripts are provided to demonstrate functionality.

## Quickstart

To try out a pre-configured, follow these steps.

| Steps    |    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1.  Create project for your pipelines execution. This can be run as any non-admin user (or admin)  and is needed to hold your execution pipelines.  |  oc new-project demo     |  
| 2.  Run build-deploy example with a quarkus app. |  ./hack/build/build-deploy.sh  https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-code-with-quarkus
| 3.  View your build on the OpenShift Console under the pipelines page or view the logs via CLI. | `./hack/build/ls-builds.sh` or  `tkn.exe pipelinerun logs`      |

## Usage

A sample script `build.sh` is provided which uses the App Studio Build Service API to demonstrate launching a build and inspecting the results.
As a proof-of-concept, an optional `build-deploy.sh` script is included to take the build image and run it. .

```
./hack/build/build.sh  git-repo-url <optional-pipeline-name>
```
also the equivalent build but with an associated deploy.
```
./hack/build/build-deploy.sh  git-repo-url <optional-pipeline-name>
```

The `git-repo-url` is the git repository with your source code.
The `<optional-pipeline-name>` is the name of one of the pipelines documented in the App Studio API Contract <url here>. This pipeline name can be provide when the automatic build type detection does not find a supported build type.
Note: Normally the build type would be done automatically by (by the Component Detection Query) which maps devfile or other markers to a type of build needed. The build currently uses a shim `repo-to-pipeline.sh` to map file markers to a pipeline type. For testing and experiments the  `optional-pipeline-name`  parameter can override the default pipeline name.

The current build types supported are: `devfile-build`, `docker-build`, `java-buider` and `node-js-builder`.

For a quick "do nothing pipeline" run you can specify the `noop` buider and have a quick pipeline run that does nothing except print some logs.

`./hack/build/build.sh  https://github.com/jduimovich/single-container-app  noop`

Pipelines will be automatically installed when running a build via an OCI bundle mechanism.

To see what builds you have run, use the following examples.

Use `./hack/build/ls-builds.sh` to show all builds in the system, and `./hack/build/ls-builds.sh <build-name>` to get the stats for a specific build.

## Testing

To validate the pipelines are installed and working, you can run `./hack/build/m2-builds`  script which will build all the samples planned for milestone 2.

To deploy all the builds as they complete, add the `-deploy` option.
```
./hack/build/m2-builds -deploy

```
You can also run the noop build `./hack/build/quick-noop-build.sh`, that executes in couple seconds to validate a working install.

### Tests via AppStudio

To validate execution via AppStudio you can run `./hacb/build/build-via-appstudio.sh` script which sets credentials and AppStudio application and components. Without parameters it creates example components.

```
export MY_QUAY_USER=mkovarik
./hack/build/build-via-appstudio.sh https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-java-springboot-basic
```

## Other Build utilities

The build type is identified via temporary hack until the Component Detection Query is available which maps files in your git repo to known build types. See `./hack/build/repo-to-pipeline.sh`  which will print the repo name and computed builder type.

The system will fill with builds and logs so a utility is provided to prune pipelines and cleanup the associated storage. This is for dev mode only and will be done autatically by App Studio builds.
Use `./hack/build/prune-builds.sh` for a single cleanup pass, and `./hack/build/prune-builds-loop.sh` to run a continuous loop to cleanup extra resources.

Use `./hack/build/utils/check-repo.sh` to test your what auto-detect build will return.  
```
./hack/build/utils/check-repo.sh  https://github.com/jduimovich/single-java-app
https://github.com/jduimovich/single-java-app   -> java-builder

```
If you want to check all your repos to see which ones may build you can use this script. You need to set you github id `export MY_GITHUB_USER=your-username` and it will test your repo for buildable content.  

```
./hack/build/utils/ls-all-my-repos.sh | xargs -n 1 ./hack/build/utils/check-repo.sh
```

### Tekton Results integration

[Tekton Results](https://github.com/tektoncd/results) is installed in the cluster. Helper script `hack/build/set-tkn-results.sh` is provided to set configuration of for `tkn results` command.

```
# ./hack/build/set-tkn-results.sh
Configuration written to /home/myuser/.config/tkn/results.yaml

Try it: tkn results list default
```

# Invoking the API

## GitOps Service

Once the cluster is successfully bootstrapped, create a Namespace with the `argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by: gitops-service-argocd` label, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: (your-user-name)
  labels:
    argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by: gitops-service-argocd
```

The `argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by: gitops-service-argocd` label gives 'permission' to Argo CD (specifically, the instance in `gitops-service-argocd`) to deploy to your namespace.

You may now create `GitOpsDeployment` resources, which the GitOps Service will respond to, deploying resources to your namespace:
```yaml
apiVersion: managed-gitops.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsDeployment

metadata:
  name: gitops-depl
  namespace: (your-user-name)

spec:

  # Application/component to deploy
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/gitops-repository-template
    path: environments/overlays/dev

  # destination: {}  # destination is user namespace if empty

  # Only 'automated' type is currently supported: changes to the GitOps repo immediately take effect (as soon as Argo CD detects them).
  type: automated
```


See the [GitOps Service M2 Demo script for more details](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/managed-gitops/tree/main/examples/m2-demo#run-the-demo).

# FAQ

Other questions? Ask on `#wg-developer-appstudio`.

### Q: How do I deliver K8s resources in stages? For example, installing a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) first, then installing the Custom Resource (CR) for that CRD.

As long as your resources are declaratively defined, they will eventually be reconciled with the cluster (it just may take Argo CD a few retries). For example, the CRs might fail before the CRDs are applied, but on retry the CRDs will now exist (as they were applied during the previous retry). So now those CRs can progress.

_However_, this is not true if you are installing an Operator (e.g. Tekton) via OLM `Subscription`, and then using an operand of that operator (e.g. `Pipeline` CRs), at the same time. In this case, you will need to add the `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true` annotation to the operands (or add it to the parent `kustomization.yaml`).

See the FAQ question '_the server could not find the requested resource_' below for details.

For finer-grained control of resource apply ordering, use Argo CD [Sync waves](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/) (Here is an [example](https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps/tree/master/sync-waves)).


### Q: What if I want my service's K8s resources in a separate Git repository? (i.e. not this one)

Ultimately, as a team, we should decide on a resource deployment strategy going forward: whether we want every team's K8s resources to be defined within this repository (as a GitOps monorepo), or within individual team's Git repositories. IMHO it is easiest to coordinate deployments within a single Git repository (such as this one), rather than multiple independent repositories.

However, if one or more services want to split off their K8s resource into independent repositories owned by those teams, they can modify the Argo CD `Application` CR for their service (created in 'How to add your own component' step 3, above) to point to their new repository.

### Q: How can I install an Operator to the cluster using Argo CD?

To install an operator, you only need to include the OLM `Subscription` and `OperatorGroup` CRs for the operator under your deployed resources folder within this repository. If the operator is not available in OperatorHub, then you need to include also the OLM `CatalogSource` CR.

For an example of this, see the [Red Hat CoP GitOps catalog](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog), for example the [Web Terminal operator example](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/blob/main/web-terminal-operator/base/operator/web-terminal-subscription.yaml).

### Q: When Argo CD attempts to synchronize my Argo CD Application, I am seeing 'the server could not find the requested resource' sync error on my custom resources. How can I fix this?

Before Argo CD attempts a synchronize operation (syncing your Git repository with the K8s cluster), it performs a dry-run to ensure that all the K8s resources in your Git repository are valid. If your repository contains custom resources which are not yet defined (for example, Tekton `Pipeline` CRs), it will refuse to begin the synchronize operation.

This most often occurs when a Git repository contains both the OLM `Subscription` (which will install the desired operator, e.g. Tekton), and also the operands of that operator (the `Pipeline` CRs).

The easiest way to solve this is to add this annotation to your custom resources operands:  `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true`.

For example, we would add this annotation to _all of our_ Pipeline CRs:
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  # Add this annotation to your CRs:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
```

If you are using Kustomize, you can place the following in your `kustomization.yaml` file to automatically add it to all resources:
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- # (your resources)

# Add these lines to your kustomization.yaml:
commonAnnotations:
  argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
```

See the Argo CD docs [for more on this sync option](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/#skip-dry-run-for-new-custom-resources-types). See the [redhat-cop/gitops-catalog](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog) for examples of this option used with Kustomize and OLM-installed operators.

### Q: Logging into ArgoCD stops working and shows message: Failed to query provider.
If you stopped and started your cluster, a timing issue might cause the following message to appear
when you try logging into ArgoCD with `Log In Via OpenShift`:
```
Failed to query provider "https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.apps.myserver.mydomain.com/api/dex": Get "http://openshift-gitops-dex-server.openshift-gitops.svc.cluster.local:5556/api/dex/.well-known/openid-configuration": dial tcp 1##.###.###.###:5556: connect: connection refused
```
To correct this problem:
+ Delete the openshift-gitops-dex-server-* pod:
```
oc delete pods -n openshift-gitops -l app.kubernetes.io/name=openshift-gitops-dex-server
```
+ The pod will automatically restart and ArgoCD `Log In Via OpenShift` should be working again.


### Q: What is the recommended memory and CPU allocation for CodeReady Containers for development purposes?

We recommend 7+ cores and 24+ GiB (24576 MiB) of memory.

### Q: When using CodeReady Containers for development purposes, I am getting an error message similar to: `0/1 nodes available: insufficient memory`.

The default worker node memory allocation of 8192 MiB insufficient to run App Studio. Increase the memory to 16 MiB using `crc config set memory 16384` and then create a new CRC VM to apply your changes, using `crc delete` and `crc start`. Finally, repeat the cluster bootstrapping process.

See the CodeReady Containers docs [for more on this configuration option](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.7/html/getting_started_guide/configuring-codeready-containers_gsg).

### Q: When using CodeReady Containers for development purposes, I am getting an error message similar to: `0/1 nodes available: insufficient cpu`.

The default 4-CPU allocation will not be sufficient for the CPU resource requests in this repo. Increase number of cores, for example, `crc config set cpus 6` if your hardware supports it, and then create a new CRC VM to apply your changes, using `crc delete` and `crc start`. Finally, repeat the cluster bootstrapping process.

See the CodeReady Containers docs [for more on this configuration option](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.7/html/getting_started_guide/configuring-codeready-containers_gsg).

Even with 6 CPU cores, you will need to reduce the CPU resource requests for each App Studio application. Using `kubectl edit argocd/openshift-gitops -n openshift-gitops`, reduce the resources.requests.cpu values from 250m to 100m or less. For example, change each line with
```
requests:
    cpu: 250m
```
to
```
requests:
    cpu: 100m
```
Then [save and exit the editor](https://vim.rtorr.com/). The updates will be applied to the cluster immediately, and the App Studio deployment should complete within a few minutes.
