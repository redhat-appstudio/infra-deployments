# Network Policy: Default Deny All
#
# Purpose: Implements a "deny all / permit by exception" security model
#
# Behavior:
#   - Blocks ALL ingress traffic by default
#   - Blocks ALL egress traffic by default
#   - Other NetworkPolicies selectively allow specific traffic patterns
#
# Security: Aligns with ESO threat model recommendations
