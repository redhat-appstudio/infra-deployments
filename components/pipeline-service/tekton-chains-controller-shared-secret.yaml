    spec:
      # Chains expects a file named config.json under the DOCKER_CONFIG dir.
      # Since the underlying Secret defines the key .dockerconfigjson, that's
      # also the name of the file that is mounted on the container.
      #
      # We could use subPath to "rename" the file. However, that causes two
      # issues. First, updates to the Secret are not reflected on the container,
      # see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/50345. Second, if
      # the underlying Secret does not exist, config.json is mounted as a dir
      # instead of a file which breaks the k8schain library used by Tekton
      # Chains.
      #
      # By using a init container, we can mount the volume as is and ensure that
      # config.json (the symlink) is a file.
