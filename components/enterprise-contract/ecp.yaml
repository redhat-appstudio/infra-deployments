    Use the policy rules from the "minimal" collection. This and other collections are defined in

    The minimal collection is a small set of policy rules that should be easy to pass for brand new
    Stonesoup users. If a different policy configuration is desired, this resource can serve as a
    starting point. See the docs on how to include and exclude rules
