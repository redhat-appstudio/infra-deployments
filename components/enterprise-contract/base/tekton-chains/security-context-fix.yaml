# The default install of chains includes the following
# which (iiuc) works in kubernetes but not openshift.
#
#    # User 65532 is the distroless nonroot user ID
#    runAsUser: 65532
#    runAsGroup: 65532
#
# The suggested workaround is to run this command:
#   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z tekton-chains-controller
#
# but instead of that workaround we'll remove the runAsUser and
# runAsGroup config.
