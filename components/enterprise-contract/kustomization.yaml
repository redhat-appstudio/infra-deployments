# Kustomize does not allow github.com urls that reference a single-file. They must always reference
# a directory that contains a kustomization.yaml file. The directory /config/rbac does include a
# kustomization.yaml file but it includes many other RBAC changes that are not desirable here. Use
# a URL to the "raw" version of the file instead.
