# App Studio/HACBS Build System

The App Studio/HACBS Build System is composed of the following components:

- [OpenShift Pipelines](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html)
- [Tekton Chains](https://github.com/tektoncd/chains)
- [Tekton Results](https://github.com/tektoncd/results)
- [Pipelines as Code](https://pipelinesascode.com/)
- [Shared Resources](https://github.com/openshift/csi-driver-shared-resource)
- [App Studio Build Service](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-service/)
- [HACBS JVM Build Service](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/jvm-build-service)
- [PVC Cleaner](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/pvc-cleaner/)

This repository installs all the components and includes a set of example scripts that simplify usage and provide examples of a working system. There are no additional components needed to use the build system API, however some utilities and scripts are provided to demonstrate functionality.

## Quickstart

To try out a pre-configured, follow these steps.

| Steps    |    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1.  Create project for your pipelines execution. This can be run as any non-admin user (or admin)  and is needed to hold your execution pipelines.  |  oc new-project demo     |
| 2.  Run build-deploy example with a quarkus app. | MY_QUAY_USER=mkovarik ./hack/build/build-via-appstudio.sh https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-code-with-quarkus
| 3.  View your build on the OpenShift Console under the pipelines page or view the logs via CLI. | `tkn pipelinerun logs`      |

## Tests via AppStudio

To validate execution via AppStudio you can run `./hack/build/build-via-appstudio.sh` script which sets credentials and AppStudio application and components. Without parameters it creates example components.

```
export MY_QUAY_USER=mkovarik
./hack/build/build-via-appstudio.sh https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-java-springboot-basic
```

To enable PipelineAsCode integration you need to set `PIPELINESASCODE` env variable and also have to have set `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` and `GITHUB_APP_ID` in your `./hack/preview.env`. The github app has to be installed on your testing repository.

```
MY_QUAY_USER=mkovarik PIPELINESASCODE=1 ./hack/build/build-via-appstudio.sh https://github.com/Michkov/devfile-sample-go-basic
```

### Change of default pipeline bundle

Pipeline bundles are generated by [build-definitions](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions).
By default the bundle is defined in `build-templates` namespace:
```
oc get configmap -n build-templates -o jsonpath='{ .data.default_build_bundle }' build-pipelines-defaults
```

It can be overridden by configmap in working namespace:
```
oc create configmap build-pipelines-defaults --from-literal default_build_bundle=$BUNDLE
```

Switching to HACBS bundle:
```
HACBS_BUNDLE=$(oc get configmap -n build-templates -o jsonpath='{ .data.default_build_bundle }' build-pipelines-defaults | sed 's|/build-|/hacbs-|)
oc delete configmap --ignore-not-found build-pipelines-defaults
oc create configmap build-pipelines-defaults --from-literal default_build_bundle=$HACBS_BUNDLE
```

## Tekton Results integration

[Tekton Results](https://github.com/tektoncd/results) is installed in the cluster. Helper script `hack/build/set-tkn-results.sh` is provided to set configuration of for `tkn results` command.

```
# ./hack/build/set-tkn-results.sh
Configuration written to /home/myuser/.config/tkn/results.yaml

Try it: tkn results list default
```

## Shared Resources

Shared Secrets are provided to be used by projects, secrets is defined in one project but can be used by other projects.

Available secrets:

| Name | Source | Description | Access |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| test-team-snyk | test-teams-snyk secret in test-team namespace | Snyk token used by HACBS pipelines | users/serviceaccounts with edit role |
| redhat-appstudio-user-workload | redhat-appstudio-user-workload secret in build-templates namespace | Quay secret allowing to push into default AppStudio repository | users/serviceaccounts with edit role, but application-service and build-service both have protection that prevents one user to push to a different user's tag, and the default repository is protected from updates from other namespaces |
| redhat-appstudio-staginguser | redhat-appstudio-staginguser secret in build-templates namespace | Quay secret allowing to push into component repositories in redhat-appstudio org | `pipeline` service accounts defined in [shared-resources-components.yaml](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments/blob/main/components/build/shared-resources/shared-resources-components.yaml)|

### Repository secrets

There are three ways to provide repository secret into PipelineRun.

By priority (1. is highest):

1. `redhat-appstudio-registry-pull-secret` secret in the execution namespace
2. linked secret to `pipeline` service account in the execution namespace
3. shared secret `redhat-appstudio-user-workload`

### Use SharedSecret with Tekton Chains

During the build pipeline, it is possible to use the `redhat-appstudio-user-workload`
[SharedSecret](https://github.com/openshift/csi-driver-shared-resource) to specify the credentials
for pushing container images. If this is used, Tekton Chains must also be configured to use the
same `SharedSecret`. This is done by default. However, the `Secret` referred to by the
`SharedSecret` may not exist at bootstrap time. This is ok. The underlying `Secret` can be created
at a later time, and/or updated as needed. The changes should be reflected automatically within the
Tekton Chains Controller without requiring a Pod restart.
