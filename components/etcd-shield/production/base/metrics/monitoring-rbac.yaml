# etcd-shield is registered as a core service (the
# openshift.io/cluster-monitoring label on the namespace), rather than as a
# user workload. This is necessary because we need access to etcd's metrics to
# function properly. However, this means openshift's monitoring services can't
# use the user workload monitoring roles to fetch our metrics (specifically,
# they need pods, services, and endpoints). This is a bit of a workaround to
# get prometheus to be able to recognize our metrics endpoints, since I don't
# know of a better way to do this.
