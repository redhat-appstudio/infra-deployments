name: PR Environment Labels

# Known limitation: labels are computed at PR-event time and are NOT
# refreshed when the base branch (main) changes.  Any structural change
# to main that alters the dependency graph between files and overlays can
# make labels on open PRs stale until the next push to those PRs.
#
# Examples:
#   - A new production cluster overlay is added to main that references
#     a component modified by an already-open PR.
#   - A kustomization in main gains a new resource/helmChart/generator
#     that pulls in a directory the PR modifies.
#   - An ApplicationSet in main changes its source path, shifting which
#     files map to which environment.
#   - An overlay is removed from main, but open PRs still carry its label.
#
# In practice this is rare — it requires the dependency structure to
# change in main while an open PR touches the affected component, and
# the PR to merge without any subsequent push.
